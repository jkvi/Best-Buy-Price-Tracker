# Best-Buy-Price-Tracker
This script is a price and stock tracker for BestBuy products.
- It scrapes product pages to get the latest price, availability, and sale info.
- It compares the current data to previous data stored in a file.
- If price drops or stock changes, it alerts you via desktop notification or optionally email.
- It can track multiple products at once and remember previous prices for ongoing monitoring.

Essentially, it’s an automated way to watch BestBuy products so you never miss a sale or stock restock.
